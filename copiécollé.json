VERBATIM ONLY:\n   - Copy text EXACTLY character-by-character from the source\n   - DO NOT simplify, abbreviate, or shorten ANY term\n   - DO NOT translate between languages\n     (keep \"Licence\", NOT \"Bachelor\")\n   - DO NOT merge compound terms\n     (keep \"Bachelor of Commerce\", NOT \"Bachelor\")\n\n2.

FIELD SEPARATION:\n   - NEVER mix information between fields\n   - \"field\" contains ONLY domain/specialization OR explicit exchange label\n   - \"level_of_degree\" contains ONLY academic level EXACTLY as written\n   - If unsure, use \"not found\" for both rather than mixing\n\n4. ABSENT vs IMPLICIT:\n   - Extract ONLY what is EXPLICITLY stated\n   - \"Bachelor of Commerce\" → level: \"Bachelor of Commerce\"\n   - \"Summer course in Marketing\" → level: \"not found\", field: \"Marketing\"\n   - \"Engineering School\" → university: \"Engineering School\", field: \"not found\"\n\n5. EXCHANGE LABELING RULE:\n   - If the source explicitly contains \"Erasmus\", \"Exchange program\",\n     \"Study abroad\", or equivalent:\n       • Keep the term VERBATIM in the extracted field where it appears\n       • DO NOT convert it into a degree level\n       • DO NOT treat it as a full academic degree\n\n6.

EXCHANGE LABELING RULE:\n   - If the source explicitly contains \"Erasmus\", \"Exchange program\",\n     \"Study abroad\", or equivalent:\n       • Keep the term VERBATIM in the extracted field where it appears\n       • DO NOT convert it into a degree level\n       • DO NOT treat it as a full academic degree\n\n6. QUALITY VALIDATION:\n   - Each field must contain only ONE type of information\n   - Exchange programs must NOT be at the same level as full degrees\n   - If in doubt, be conservative and use \"not found\"\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS:\n❌ Simplifying degree names\n❌ Adding program types not in source\n❌ Mixing field and level\n❌ Translating terminology\n❌ Inferring missing information\n❌ Inventing dates for Erasmus or exchange programs\n\nFIELD DEFINITIONS:\n- \"university\": Educational establishment name ONLY (verbatim)\n- \"level_of_degree\": Academic level EXACTLY as stated\n- \"field\": Domain / specialization OR explicit exchange label (verbatim)\n- \"country or city\": Geographic location (verbatim)\n- \"dates\": Temporal range (verbatim)\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Bachelor of Commerce in Accounting, McGill University, 2015-2019\"\nOutput:\n{\n  \"university\": \"McGill University\",\n  \"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor of Commerce\",\n  \"field\": \"Accounting\",\n  \"country or city\": \"not found\",\n  \"dates\": \"2015-2019\"\n}\n\n✅ CORRECT (exchange):\nSource: \"Erasmus exchange at University of Barcelona\"\nOutput:\n{\n  \"university\": \"University of Barcelona\",\n  \"level_of_degree\": \"not found\",\n  \"field\": \"Erasmus exchange\",\n  \"country or city\": \"not found\",\n  \"dates\": \"not found\"\n}\n\n❌ WRONG (date inference):\nSource: \"Erasmus exchange at University of Barcelona\"\nWrong Output:\n{\"dates\": \"2019-2020\"}\nCorrect:\n{\"dates\": \"not found\"}\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"studies\": [\n    {\n      \"university\": \"verbatim text or 'not found'\",\n      \"level_of_degree\": \"verbatim complete degree name or 'not found'\",\n      \"field\": \"verbatim specialization or 'not found'\",\n      \"country or city\": \"verbatim location or 'not found'\",\n      \"dates\": \"verbatim dates or 'not found'\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n",

FIELD SEPARATION:\n   - NEVER mix information between fields\n   - \"field\" contains ONLY domain/specialization OR explicit exchange label\n   - \"level_of_degree\" contains ONLY academic level EXACTLY as written\n   - If unsure, use \"not found\" for both rather than mixing\n\n4. ABSENT vs IMPLICIT:\n   - Extract ONLY what is EXPLICITLY stated\n   - \"Bachelor of Commerce\" → level: \"Bachelor of Commerce\"\n   - \"Summer course in Marketing\" → level: \"not found\", field: \"Marketing\"\n   - \"Engineering School\" → university: \"Engineering School\", field: \"not found\"\n\n5. EXCHANGE LABELING RULE:\n   - If the source explicitly contains \"Erasmus\", \"Exchange program\",\n     \"Study abroad\", or equivalent:\n       • Keep the term VERBATIM in the extracted field where it appears\n       • DO NOT convert it into a degree level\n       • DO NOT treat it as a full academic degree\n\n6. QUALITY VALIDATION:\n   - Each field must contain only ONE type of information\n   - Exchange programs must NOT be at the same level as full degrees\n   - If in doubt, be conservative and use \"not found\"\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS:\n❌ Simplifying degree names\n❌ Adding program types not in source\n❌ Mixing field and level\n❌ Translating terminology\n❌ Inferring missing information\n❌ Inventing dates for Erasmus or exchange programs\n\nFIELD DEFINITIONS:\n- \"university\": Educational establishment name ONLY (verbatim)\n- \"level_of_degree\": Academic level EXACTLY as stated\n- \"field\": Domain / specialization OR explicit exchange label (verbatim)\n- \"country or city\": Geographic location (verbatim)\n- \"dates\": Temporal range (verbatim)\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Bachelor of Commerce in Accounting, McGill University, 2015-2019\"\nOutput:\n{\n  \"university\": \"McGill University\",\n  \"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor of Commerce\",\n  \"field\": \"Accounting\",\n  \"country or city\": \"not found\",\n  \"dates\": \"2015-2019\"\n}\n\n✅ CORRECT (exchange):\nSource: \"Erasmus exchange at University of Barcelona\"\nOutput:\n{\n  \"university\": \"University of Barcelona\",\n  \"level_of_degree\": \"not found\",\n  \"field\": \"Erasmus exchange\",\n  \"country or city\": \"not found\",\n  \"dates\": \"not found\"\n}\n\n❌ WRONG (date inference):\nSource: \"Erasmus exchange at University of Barcelona\"\nWrong Output:\n{\"dates\": \"2019-2020\"}\nCorrect:\n{\"dates\": \"not found\"}\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"studies\": [\n    {\n      \"university\": \"verbatim text or 'not found'\",\n      \"level_of_degree\": \"verbatim complete degree name or 'not found'\",\n      \"field\": \"verbatim specialization or 'not found'\",\n      \"country or city\": \"verbatim location or 'not found'\",\n      \"dates\": \"verbatim dates or 'not found'\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n",

QUALITY VALIDATION:\n   - Each field must contain only ONE type of information\n   - Exchange programs must NOT be at the same level as full degrees\n   - If in doubt, be conservative and use \"not found\"\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS:\n❌ Simplifying degree names\n❌ Adding program types not in source\n❌ Mixing field and level\n❌ Translating terminology\n❌ Inferring missing information\n❌ Inventing dates for Erasmus or exchange programs\n\nFIELD DEFINITIONS:\n- \"university\": Educational establishment name ONLY (verbatim)\n- \"level_of_degree\": Academic level EXACTLY as stated\n- \"field\": Domain / specialization OR explicit exchange label (verbatim)\n- \"country or city\": Geographic location (verbatim)\n- \"dates\": Temporal range (verbatim)\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Bachelor of Commerce in Accounting, McGill University, 2015-2019\"\nOutput:\n{\n  \"university\": \"McGill University\",\n  \"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor of Commerce\",\n  \"field\": \"Accounting\",\n  \"country or city\": \"not found\",\n  \"dates\": \"2015-2019\"\n}\n\n✅ CORRECT (exchange):\nSource: \"Erasmus exchange at University of Barcelona\"\nOutput:\n{\n  \"university\": \"University of Barcelona\",\n  \"level_of_degree\": \"not found\",\n  \"field\": \"Erasmus exchange\",\n  \"country or city\": \"not found\",\n  \"dates\": \"not found\"\n}\n\n❌ WRONG (date inference):\nSource: \"Erasmus exchange at University of Barcelona\"\nWrong Output:\n{\"dates\": \"2019-2020\"}\nCorrect:\n{\"dates\": \"not found\"}\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"studies\": [\n    {\n      \"university\": \"verbatim text or 'not found'\",\n      \"level_of_degree\": \"verbatim complete degree name or 'not found'\",\n      \"field\": \"verbatim specialization or 'not found'\",\n      \"country or city\": \"verbatim location or 'not found'\",\n      \"dates\": \"verbatim dates or 'not found'\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n",
