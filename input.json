You must still extract interests from these sections as long as they clearly contain interests/hobbies. Do NOT extract from other sections.\n\nCRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES (MANDATORY):\n1. VERBATIM ONLY: Copy interests EXACTLY as written in the source\n   - DO NOT translate (keep \"Football\", don't change to \"Soccer\")\n   - DO NOT simplify or generalize (keep \"Marathon running\", NOT \"Running\")\n   - DO NOT categorize or group (keep each interest separate)\n\n2. NO INFERENCE: Only extract explicitly stated interests\n   - DO NOT infer interests from other CV sections\n   - DO NOT add generic interests\n   - DO NOT deduce hobbies from skills or experiences\n\n3. COMPLETENESS: Extract ALL interests mentioned\n   - If section is absent, return empty list []\n   - Include all items even if similar (e.g., \"Chess\", \"Online Chess\" are two items)\n\n4. SECTION DETECTION:\n   - If a section title contains ANY of these keywords, treat it as the interests section:\n     \"Interest\", \"Interests\", \"Hobbies\", \"Activities\", \"Extra-curricular\"\n   - Examples of valid section headers:\n     \"Languages and Interests\"\n     \"Interests & Activities\"\n     \"Hobbies and Interests\"\n     \"Personal Interests / Languages\"\n     \"Extra-curricular Activities\"\n   - Do NOT extract from sections that only mention \"Languages\" without any interests.\n\n5. FORMAT: Return as simple string list\n   - Each interest is one string item\n   - Keep original language and terminology\n   - Preserve any descriptive terms (e.g., \"Competitive swimming\" not \"Swimming\")\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS:\n❌ Translating terms (\"Football\" → \"Soccer\")\n❌ Simplifying descriptions (\"Marathon running\" → \"Running\")\n❌ Inferring interests not explicitly stated\n❌ Grouping similar interests (\"Tennis, Badminton\" → \"Racket sports\")\n❌ Adding interests from other CV sections\n\nEXAMPLES:\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Hobbies: Chess, Marathon running, Reading science fiction\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Marathon running\", \"Reading science fiction\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (section with different name):\nSource: \"Languages and Interests: French, English, Chess, Cooking\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Cooking\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (empty):\nSource: [No interests section found]\nOutput: {\"interests\": []}\n\n❌ WRONG (translation):\nSource: \"Football, Natation\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Soccer\", \"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Football\", \"Natation\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (simplification):\nSource: \"Competitive swimming\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Competitive swimming\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (inference):\nSource: [Education section mentions \"Chess club president\"]\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": []} (not in interests section)\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"interests\": [\"verbatim interest 1\", \"verbatim interest 2\", ...]\n}\n\nIf no interests section exists, return:\n{\n  \"interests\": []\n}\n",

You must still extract interests from these sections as long as they clearly contain interests/hobbies. Do NOT extract from other sections.\n\nCRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES (MANDATORY):\n1. VERBATIM ONLY: Copy interests EXACTLY as written in the source\n   - DO NOT translate (keep \"Football\", don't change to \"Soccer\")\n   - DO NOT simplify or generalize (keep \"Marathon running\", NOT \"Running\")\n   - DO NOT categorize or group (keep each interest separate)\n\n2. NO INFERENCE: Only extract explicitly stated interests\n   - DO NOT infer interests from other CV sections\n   - DO NOT add generic interests\n   - DO NOT deduce hobbies from skills or experiences\n\n3. COMPLETENESS: Extract ALL interests mentioned\n   - If section is absent, return empty list []\n   - Include all items even if similar (e.g., \"Chess\", \"Online Chess\" are two items)\n\n4. SECTION DETECTION:\n   - If a section title contains ANY of these keywords, treat it as the interests section:\n     \"Interest\", \"Interests\", \"Hobbies\", \"Activities\", \"Extra-curricular\"\n   - Examples of valid section headers:\n     \"Languages and Interests\"\n     \"Interests & Activities\"\n     \"Hobbies and Interests\"\n     \"Personal Interests / Languages\"\n     \"Extra-curricular Activities\"\n   - Do NOT extract from sections that only mention \"Languages\" without any interests.\n\n5. FORMAT: Return as simple string list\n   - Each interest is one string item\n   - Keep original language and terminology\n   - Preserve any descriptive terms (e.g., \"Competitive swimming\" not \"Swimming\")\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS:\n❌ Translating terms (\"Football\" → \"Soccer\")\n❌ Simplifying descriptions (\"Marathon running\" → \"Running\")\n❌ Inferring interests not explicitly stated\n❌ Grouping similar interests (\"Tennis, Badminton\" → \"Racket sports\")\n❌ Adding interests from other CV sections\n\nEXAMPLES:\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Hobbies: Chess, Marathon running, Reading science fiction\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Marathon running\", \"Reading science fiction\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (section with different name):\nSource: \"Languages and Interests: French, English, Chess, Cooking\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Cooking\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (empty):\nSource: [No interests section found]\nOutput: {\"interests\": []}\n\n❌ WRONG (translation):\nSource: \"Football, Natation\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Soccer\", \"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Football\", \"Natation\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (simplification):\nSource: \"Competitive swimming\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Competitive swimming\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (inference):\nSource: [Education section mentions \"Chess club president\"]\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": []} (not in interests section)\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"interests\": [\"verbatim interest 1\", \"verbatim interest 2\", ...]\n}\n\nIf no interests section exists, return:\n{\n  \"interests\": []\n}\n",

FORMAT: Return as simple string list\n   - Each interest is one string item\n   - Keep original language and terminology\n   - Preserve any descriptive terms (e.g., \"Competitive swimming\" not \"Swimming\")\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS:\n❌ Translating terms (\"Football\" → \"Soccer\")\n❌ Simplifying descriptions (\"Marathon running\" → \"Running\")\n❌ Inferring interests not explicitly stated\n❌ Grouping similar interests (\"Tennis, Badminton\" → \"Racket sports\")\n❌ Adding interests from other CV sections\n\nEXAMPLES:\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Hobbies: Chess, Marathon running, Reading science fiction\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Marathon running\", \"Reading science fiction\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (section with different name):\nSource: \"Languages and Interests: French, English, Chess, Cooking\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Cooking\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (empty):\nSource: [No interests section found]\nOutput: {\"interests\": []}\n\n❌ WRONG (translation):\nSource: \"Football, Natation\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Soccer\", \"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Football\", \"Natation\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (simplification):\nSource: \"Competitive swimming\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Competitive swimming\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (inference):\nSource: [Education section mentions \"Chess club president\"]\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": []} (not in interests section)\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"interests\": [\"verbatim interest 1\", \"verbatim interest 2\", ...]\n}\n\nIf no interests section exists, return:\n{\n  \"interests\": []\n}\n",

You must still extract interests from these sections as long as they clearly contain interests/hobbies. Do NOT extract from other sections.\n\nCRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES (MANDATORY):\n1.

COMPLETENESS: Extract ALL interests mentioned\n   - If section is absent, return empty list []\n   - Include all items even if similar (e.g., \"Chess\", \"Online Chess\" are two items)\n\n4.

FORMAT: Return as simple string list\n   - Each interest is one string item\n   - Keep original language and terminology\n   - Preserve any descriptive terms (e.g., \"Competitive swimming\" not \"Swimming\")\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS:\n❌ Translating terms (\"Football\" → \"Soccer\")\n❌ Simplifying descriptions (\"Marathon running\" → \"Running\")\n❌ Inferring interests not explicitly stated\n❌ Grouping similar interests (\"Tennis, Badminton\" → \"Racket sports\")\n❌ Adding interests from other CV sections\n\nEXAMPLES:\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Hobbies: Chess, Marathon running, Reading science fiction\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Marathon running\", \"Reading science fiction\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (section with different name):\nSource: \"Languages and Interests: French, English, Chess, Cooking\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Cooking\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (empty):\nSource: [No interests section found]\nOutput: {\"interests\": []}\n\n❌ WRONG (translation):\nSource: \"Football, Natation\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Soccer\", \"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Football\", \"Natation\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (simplification):\nSource: \"Competitive swimming\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Competitive swimming\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (inference):\nSource: [Education section mentions \"Chess club president\"]\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": []} (not in interests section)\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"interests\": [\"verbatim interest 1\", \"verbatim interest 2\", ...]\n}\n\nIf no interests section exists, return:\n{\n  \"interests\": []\n}\n",

COMPLETENESS: Extract ALL interests mentioned\n   - If section is absent, return empty list []\n   - Include all items even if similar (e.g., \"Chess\", \"Online Chess\" are two items)\n\n4. SECTION DETECTION:\n   - If a section title contains ANY of these keywords, treat it as the interests section:\n     \"Interest\", \"Interests\", \"Hobbies\", \"Activities\", \"Extra-curricular\"\n   - Examples of valid section headers:\n     \"Languages and Interests\"\n     \"Interests & Activities\"\n     \"Hobbies and Interests\"\n     \"Personal Interests / Languages\"\n     \"Extra-curricular Activities\"\n   - Do NOT extract from sections that only mention \"Languages\" without any interests.\n\n5. FORMAT: Return as simple string list\n   - Each interest is one string item\n   - Keep original language and terminology\n   - Preserve any descriptive terms (e.g., \"Competitive swimming\" not \"Swimming\")\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS:\n❌ Translating terms (\"Football\" → \"Soccer\")\n❌ Simplifying descriptions (\"Marathon running\" → \"Running\")\n❌ Inferring interests not explicitly stated\n❌ Grouping similar interests (\"Tennis, Badminton\" → \"Racket sports\")\n❌ Adding interests from other CV sections\n\nEXAMPLES:\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Hobbies: Chess, Marathon running, Reading science fiction\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Marathon running\", \"Reading science fiction\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (section with different name):\nSource: \"Languages and Interests: French, English, Chess, Cooking\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Cooking\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (empty):\nSource: [No interests section found]\nOutput: {\"interests\": []}\n\n❌ WRONG (translation):\nSource: \"Football, Natation\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Soccer\", \"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Football\", \"Natation\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (simplification):\nSource: \"Competitive swimming\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Competitive swimming\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (inference):\nSource: [Education section mentions \"Chess club president\"]\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": []} (not in interests section)\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"interests\": [\"verbatim interest 1\", \"verbatim interest 2\", ...]\n}\n\nIf no interests section exists, return:\n{\n  \"interests\": []\n}\n",

You must still extract interests from these sections as long as they clearly contain interests/hobbies. Do NOT extract from other sections.\n\nCRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES (MANDATORY):\n1.

NO INFERENCE: Only extract explicitly stated interests\n   - DO NOT infer interests from other CV sections\n   - DO NOT add generic interests\n   - DO NOT deduce hobbies from skills or experiences\n\n3. COMPLETENESS: Extract ALL interests mentioned\n   - If section is absent, return empty list []\n   - Include all items even if similar (e.g., \"Chess\", \"Online Chess\" are two items)\n\n4. SECTION DETECTION:\n   - If a section title contains ANY of these keywords, treat it as the interests section:\n     \"Interest\", \"Interests\", \"Hobbies\", \"Activities\", \"Extra-curricular\"\n   - Examples of valid section headers:\n     \"Languages and Interests\"\n     \"Interests & Activities\"\n     \"Hobbies and Interests\"\n     \"Personal Interests / Languages\"\n     \"Extra-curricular Activities\"\n   - Do NOT extract from sections that only mention \"Languages\" without any interests.\n\n5. FORMAT: Return as simple string list\n   - Each interest is one string item\n   - Keep original language and terminology\n   - Preserve any descriptive terms (e.g., \"Competitive swimming\" not \"Swimming\")\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS:\n❌ Translating terms (\"Football\" → \"Soccer\")\n❌ Simplifying descriptions (\"Marathon running\" → \"Running\")\n❌ Inferring interests not explicitly stated\n❌ Grouping similar interests (\"Tennis, Badminton\" → \"Racket sports\")\n❌ Adding interests from other CV sections\n\nEXAMPLES:\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Hobbies: Chess, Marathon running, Reading science fiction\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Marathon running\", \"Reading science fiction\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (section with different name):\nSource: \"Languages and Interests: French, English, Chess, Cooking\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Cooking\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (empty):\nSource: [No interests section found]\nOutput: {\"interests\": []}\n\n❌ WRONG (translation):\nSource: \"Football, Natation\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Soccer\", \"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Football\", \"Natation\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (simplification):\nSource: \"Competitive swimming\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Competitive swimming\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (inference):\nSource: [Education section mentions \"Chess club president\"]\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": []} (not in interests section)\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"interests\": [\"verbatim interest 1\", \"verbatim interest 2\", ...]\n}\n\nIf no interests section exists, return:\n{\n  \"interests\": []\n}\n",

NO INFERENCE: Only extract explicitly stated interests\n   - DO NOT infer interests from other CV sections\n   - DO NOT add generic interests\n   - DO NOT deduce hobbies from skills or experiences\n\n3. COMPLETENESS: Extract ALL interests mentioned\n   - If section is absent, return empty list []\n   - Include all items even if similar (e.g., \"Chess\", \"Online Chess\" are two items)\n\n4. SECTION DETECTION:\n   - If a section title contains ANY of these keywords, treat it as the interests section:\n     \"Interest\", \"Interests\", \"Hobbies\", \"Activities\", \"Extra-curricular\"\n   - Examples of valid section headers:\n     \"Languages and Interests\"\n     \"Interests & Activities\"\n     \"Hobbies and Interests\"\n     \"Personal Interests / Languages\"\n     \"Extra-curricular Activities\"\n   - Do NOT extract from sections that only mention \"Languages\" without any interests.\n\n5. FORMAT: Return as simple string list\n   - Each interest is one string item\n   - Keep original language and terminology\n   - Preserve any descriptive terms (e.g., \"Competitive swimming\" not \"Swimming\")\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS:\n❌ Translating terms (\"Football\" → \"Soccer\")\n❌ Simplifying descriptions (\"Marathon running\" → \"Running\")\n❌ Inferring interests not explicitly stated\n❌ Grouping similar interests (\"Tennis, Badminton\" → \"Racket sports\")\n❌ Adding interests from other CV sections\n\nEXAMPLES:\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Hobbies: Chess, Marathon running, Reading science fiction\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Marathon running\", \"Reading science fiction\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (section with different name):\nSource: \"Languages and Interests: French, English, Chess, Cooking\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Cooking\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (empty):\nSource: [No interests section found]\nOutput: {\"interests\": []}\n\n❌ WRONG (translation):\nSource: \"Football, Natation\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Soccer\", \"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Football\", \"Natation\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (simplification):\nSource: \"Competitive swimming\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Competitive swimming\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (inference):\nSource: [Education section mentions \"Chess club president\"]\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": []} (not in interests section)\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"interests\": [\"verbatim interest 1\", \"verbatim interest 2\", ...]\n}\n\nIf no interests section exists, return:\n{\n  \"interests\": []\n}\n",

You must still extract interests from these sections as long as they clearly contain interests/hobbies. Do NOT extract from other sections.\n\nCRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES (MANDATORY):\n1. VERBATIM ONLY: Copy interests EXACTLY as written in the source\n   - DO NOT translate (keep \"Football\", don't change to \"Soccer\")\n   - DO NOT simplify or generalize (keep \"Marathon running\", NOT \"Running\")\n   - DO NOT categorize or group (keep each interest separate)\n\n2. NO INFERENCE: Only extract explicitly stated interests\n   - DO NOT infer interests from other CV sections\n   - DO NOT add generic interests\n   - DO NOT deduce hobbies from skills or experiences\n\n3. COMPLETENESS: Extract ALL interests mentioned\n   - If section is absent, return empty list []\n   - Include all items even if similar (e.g., \"Chess\", \"Online Chess\" are two items)\n\n4. SECTION DETECTION:\n   - If a section title contains ANY of these keywords, treat it as the interests section:\n     \"Interest\", \"Interests\", \"Hobbies\", \"Activities\", \"Extra-curricular\"\n   - Examples of valid section headers:\n     \"Languages and Interests\"\n     \"Interests & Activities\"\n     \"Hobbies and Interests\"\n     \"Personal Interests / Languages\"\n     \"Extra-curricular Activities\"\n   - Do NOT extract from sections that only mention \"Languages\" without any interests.\n\n5. FORMAT: Return as simple string list\n   - Each interest is one string item\n   - Keep original language and terminology\n   - Preserve any descriptive terms (e.g., \"Competitive swimming\" not \"Swimming\")\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS:\n❌ Translating terms (\"Football\" → \"Soccer\")\n❌ Simplifying descriptions (\"Marathon running\" → \"Running\")\n❌ Inferring interests not explicitly stated\n❌ Grouping similar interests (\"Tennis, Badminton\" → \"Racket sports\")\n❌ Adding interests from other CV sections\n\nEXAMPLES:\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Hobbies: Chess, Marathon running, Reading science fiction\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Marathon running\", \"Reading science fiction\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (section with different name):\nSource: \"Languages and Interests: French, English, Chess, Cooking\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Cooking\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (empty):\nSource: [No interests section found]\nOutput: {\"interests\": []}\n\n❌ WRONG (translation):\nSource: \"Football, Natation\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Soccer\", \"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Football\", \"Natation\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (simplification):\nSource: \"Competitive swimming\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Competitive swimming\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (inference):\nSource: [Education section mentions \"Chess club president\"]\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": []} (not in interests section)\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"interests\": [\"verbatim interest 1\", \"verbatim interest 2\", ...]\n}\n\nIf no interests section exists, return:\n{\n  \"interests\": []\n}\n",

You must still extract interests from these sections as long as they clearly contain interests/hobbies. Do NOT extract from other sections.\n\nCRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES (MANDATORY):\n1. VERBATIM ONLY: Copy interests EXACTLY as written in the source\n   - DO NOT translate (keep \"Football\", don't change to \"Soccer\")\n   - DO NOT simplify or generalize (keep \"Marathon running\", NOT \"Running\")\n   - DO NOT categorize or group (keep each interest separate)\n\n2. NO INFERENCE: Only extract explicitly stated interests\n   - DO NOT infer interests from other CV sections\n   - DO NOT add generic interests\n   - DO NOT deduce hobbies from skills or experiences\n\n3. COMPLETENESS: Extract ALL interests mentioned\n   - If section is absent, return empty list []\n   - Include all items even if similar (e.g., \"Chess\", \"Online Chess\" are two items)\n\n4. SECTION DETECTION:\n   - If a section title contains ANY of these keywords, treat it as the interests section:\n     \"Interest\", \"Interests\", \"Hobbies\", \"Activities\", \"Extra-curricular\"\n   - Examples of valid section headers:\n     \"Languages and Interests\"\n     \"Interests & Activities\"\n     \"Hobbies and Interests\"\n     \"Personal Interests / Languages\"\n     \"Extra-curricular Activities\"\n   - Do NOT extract from sections that only mention \"Languages\" without any interests.\n\n5. FORMAT: Return as simple string list\n   - Each interest is one string item\n   - Keep original language and terminology\n   - Preserve any descriptive terms (e.g., \"Competitive swimming\" not \"Swimming\")\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS:\n❌ Translating terms (\"Football\" → \"Soccer\")\n❌ Simplifying descriptions (\"Marathon running\" → \"Running\")\n❌ Inferring interests not explicitly stated\n❌ Grouping similar interests (\"Tennis, Badminton\" → \"Racket sports\")\n❌ Adding interests from other CV sections\n\nEXAMPLES:\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Hobbies: Chess, Marathon running, Reading science fiction\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Marathon running\", \"Reading science fiction\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (section with different name):\nSource: \"Languages and Interests: French, English, Chess, Cooking\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Cooking\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (empty):\nSource: [No interests section found]\nOutput: {\"interests\": []}\n\n❌ WRONG (translation):\nSource: \"Football, Natation\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Soccer\", \"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Football\", \"Natation\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (simplification):\nSource: \"Competitive swimming\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Competitive swimming\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (inference):\nSource: [Education section mentions \"Chess club president\"]\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": []} (not in interests section)\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"interests\": [\"verbatim interest 1\", \"verbatim interest 2\", ...]\n}\n\nIf no interests section exists, return:\n{\n  \"interests\": []\n}\n",

VERBATIM ONLY:\n   - Copy text EXACTLY character-by-character from the source\n   - DO NOT simplify, abbreviate, or shorten ANY term\n   - DO NOT translate between languages\n     (keep \"Licence\", NOT \"Bachelor\")\n   - DO NOT merge compound terms\n     (keep \"Bachelor of Commerce\", NOT \"Bachelor\")\n\n2.

FORMAT: Return as simple string list\n   - Each interest is one string item\n   - Keep original language and terminology\n   - Preserve any descriptive terms (e.g., \"Competitive swimming\" not \"Swimming\")\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS:\n❌ Translating terms (\"Football\" → \"Soccer\")\n❌ Simplifying descriptions (\"Marathon running\" → \"Running\")\n❌ Inferring interests not explicitly stated\n❌ Grouping similar interests (\"Tennis, Badminton\" → \"Racket sports\")\n❌ Adding interests from other CV sections\n\nEXAMPLES:\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Hobbies: Chess, Marathon running, Reading science fiction\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Marathon running\", \"Reading science fiction\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (section with different name):\nSource: \"Languages and Interests: French, English, Chess, Cooking\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Cooking\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (empty):\nSource: [No interests section found]\nOutput: {\"interests\": []}\n\n❌ WRONG (translation):\nSource: \"Football, Natation\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Soccer\", \"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Football\", \"Natation\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (simplification):\nSource: \"Competitive swimming\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Competitive swimming\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (inference):\nSource: [Education section mentions \"Chess club president\"]\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": []} (not in interests section)\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"interests\": [\"verbatim interest 1\", \"verbatim interest 2\", ...]\n}\n\nIf no interests section exists, return:\n{\n  \"interests\": []\n}\n",

You must still extract interests from these sections as long as they clearly contain interests/hobbies. Do NOT extract from other sections.\n\nCRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES (MANDATORY):\n1. VERBATIM ONLY: Copy interests EXACTLY as written in the source\n   - DO NOT translate (keep \"Football\", don't change to \"Soccer\")\n   - DO NOT simplify or generalize (keep \"Marathon running\", NOT \"Running\")\n   - DO NOT categorize or group (keep each interest separate)\n\n2. NO INFERENCE: Only extract explicitly stated interests\n   - DO NOT infer interests from other CV sections\n   - DO NOT add generic interests\n   - DO NOT deduce hobbies from skills or experiences\n\n3. COMPLETENESS: Extract ALL interests mentioned\n   - If section is absent, return empty list []\n   - Include all items even if similar (e.g., \"Chess\", \"Online Chess\" are two items)\n\n4. SECTION DETECTION:\n   - If a section title contains ANY of these keywords, treat it as the interests section:\n     \"Interest\", \"Interests\", \"Hobbies\", \"Activities\", \"Extra-curricular\"\n   - Examples of valid section headers:\n     \"Languages and Interests\"\n     \"Interests & Activities\"\n     \"Hobbies and Interests\"\n     \"Personal Interests / Languages\"\n     \"Extra-curricular Activities\"\n   - Do NOT extract from sections that only mention \"Languages\" without any interests.\n\n5. FORMAT: Return as simple string list\n   - Each interest is one string item\n   - Keep original language and terminology\n   - Preserve any descriptive terms (e.g., \"Competitive swimming\" not \"Swimming\")\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS:\n❌ Translating terms (\"Football\" → \"Soccer\")\n❌ Simplifying descriptions (\"Marathon running\" → \"Running\")\n❌ Inferring interests not explicitly stated\n❌ Grouping similar interests (\"Tennis, Badminton\" → \"Racket sports\")\n❌ Adding interests from other CV sections\n\nEXAMPLES:\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Hobbies: Chess, Marathon running, Reading science fiction\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Marathon running\", \"Reading science fiction\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (section with different name):\nSource: \"Languages and Interests: French, English, Chess, Cooking\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Cooking\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (empty):\nSource: [No interests section found]\nOutput: {\"interests\": []}\n\n❌ WRONG (translation):\nSource: \"Football, Natation\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Soccer\", \"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Football\", \"Natation\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (simplification):\nSource: \"Competitive swimming\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Competitive swimming\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (inference):\nSource: [Education section mentions \"Chess club president\"]\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": []} (not in interests section)\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"interests\": [\"verbatim interest 1\", \"verbatim interest 2\", ...]\n}\n\nIf no interests section exists, return:\n{\n  \"interests\": []\n}\n",

You must still extract interests from these sections as long as they clearly contain interests/hobbies. Do NOT extract from other sections.\n\nCRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES (MANDATORY):\n1.

COMPLETENESS: Extract ALL interests mentioned\n   - If section is absent, return empty list []\n   - Include all items even if similar (e.g., \"Chess\", \"Online Chess\" are two items)\n\n4. SECTION DETECTION:\n   - If a section title contains ANY of these keywords, treat it as the interests section:\n     \"Interest\", \"Interests\", \"Hobbies\", \"Activities\", \"Extra-curricular\"\n   - Examples of valid section headers:\n     \"Languages and Interests\"\n     \"Interests & Activities\"\n     \"Hobbies and Interests\"\n     \"Personal Interests / Languages\"\n     \"Extra-curricular Activities\"\n   - Do NOT extract from sections that only mention \"Languages\" without any interests.\n\n5. FORMAT: Return as simple string list\n   - Each interest is one string item\n   - Keep original language and terminology\n   - Preserve any descriptive terms (e.g., \"Competitive swimming\" not \"Swimming\")\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS:\n❌ Translating terms (\"Football\" → \"Soccer\")\n❌ Simplifying descriptions (\"Marathon running\" → \"Running\")\n❌ Inferring interests not explicitly stated\n❌ Grouping similar interests (\"Tennis, Badminton\" → \"Racket sports\")\n❌ Adding interests from other CV sections\n\nEXAMPLES:\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Hobbies: Chess, Marathon running, Reading science fiction\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Marathon running\", \"Reading science fiction\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (section with different name):\nSource: \"Languages and Interests: French, English, Chess, Cooking\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Cooking\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (empty):\nSource: [No interests section found]\nOutput: {\"interests\": []}\n\n❌ WRONG (translation):\nSource: \"Football, Natation\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Soccer\", \"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Football\", \"Natation\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (simplification):\nSource: \"Competitive swimming\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Competitive swimming\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (inference):\nSource: [Education section mentions \"Chess club president\"]\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": []} (not in interests section)\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"interests\": [\"verbatim interest 1\", \"verbatim interest 2\", ...]\n}\n\nIf no interests section exists, return:\n{\n  \"interests\": []\n}\n",

FORMAT: Return as simple string list\n   - Each interest is one string item\n   - Keep original language and terminology\n   - Preserve any descriptive terms (e.g., \"Competitive swimming\" not \"Swimming\")\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS:\n❌ Translating terms (\"Football\" → \"Soccer\")\n❌ Simplifying descriptions (\"Marathon running\" → \"Running\")\n❌ Inferring interests not explicitly stated\n❌ Grouping similar interests (\"Tennis, Badminton\" → \"Racket sports\")\n❌ Adding interests from other CV sections\n\nEXAMPLES:\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Hobbies: Chess, Marathon running, Reading science fiction\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Marathon running\", \"Reading science fiction\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (section with different name):\nSource: \"Languages and Interests: French, English, Chess, Cooking\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Cooking\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (empty):\nSource: [No interests section found]\nOutput: {\"interests\": []}\n\n❌ WRONG (translation):\nSource: \"Football, Natation\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Soccer\", \"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Football\", \"Natation\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (simplification):\nSource: \"Competitive swimming\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Competitive swimming\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (inference):\nSource: [Education section mentions \"Chess club president\"]\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": []} (not in interests section)\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"interests\": [\"verbatim interest 1\", \"verbatim interest 2\", ...]\n}\n\nIf no interests section exists, return:\n{\n  \"interests\": []\n}\n",

You must still extract interests from these sections as long as they clearly contain interests/hobbies. Do NOT extract from other sections.\n\nCRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES (MANDATORY):\n1. VERBATIM ONLY: Copy interests EXACTLY as written in the source\n   - DO NOT translate (keep \"Football\", don't change to \"Soccer\")\n   - DO NOT simplify or generalize (keep \"Marathon running\", NOT \"Running\")\n   - DO NOT categorize or group (keep each interest separate)\n\n2. NO INFERENCE: Only extract explicitly stated interests\n   - DO NOT infer interests from other CV sections\n   - DO NOT add generic interests\n   - DO NOT deduce hobbies from skills or experiences\n\n3. COMPLETENESS: Extract ALL interests mentioned\n   - If section is absent, return empty list []\n   - Include all items even if similar (e.g., \"Chess\", \"Online Chess\" are two items)\n\n4. SECTION DETECTION:\n   - If a section title contains ANY of these keywords, treat it as the interests section:\n     \"Interest\", \"Interests\", \"Hobbies\", \"Activities\", \"Extra-curricular\"\n   - Examples of valid section headers:\n     \"Languages and Interests\"\n     \"Interests & Activities\"\n     \"Hobbies and Interests\"\n     \"Personal Interests / Languages\"\n     \"Extra-curricular Activities\"\n   - Do NOT extract from sections that only mention \"Languages\" without any interests.\n\n5. FORMAT: Return as simple string list\n   - Each interest is one string item\n   - Keep original language and terminology\n   - Preserve any descriptive terms (e.g., \"Competitive swimming\" not \"Swimming\")\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS:\n❌ Translating terms (\"Football\" → \"Soccer\")\n❌ Simplifying descriptions (\"Marathon running\" → \"Running\")\n❌ Inferring interests not explicitly stated\n❌ Grouping similar interests (\"Tennis, Badminton\" → \"Racket sports\")\n❌ Adding interests from other CV sections\n\nEXAMPLES:\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Hobbies: Chess, Marathon running, Reading science fiction\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Marathon running\", \"Reading science fiction\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (section with different name):\nSource: \"Languages and Interests: French, English, Chess, Cooking\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Cooking\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (empty):\nSource: [No interests section found]\nOutput: {\"interests\": []}\n\n❌ WRONG (translation):\nSource: \"Football, Natation\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Soccer\", \"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Football\", \"Natation\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (simplification):\nSource: \"Competitive swimming\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Competitive swimming\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (inference):\nSource: [Education section mentions \"Chess club president\"]\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": []} (not in interests section)\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"interests\": [\"verbatim interest 1\", \"verbatim interest 2\", ...]\n}\n\nIf no interests section exists, return:\n{\n  \"interests\": []\n}\n",

You must still extract interests from these sections as long as they clearly contain interests/hobbies. Do NOT extract from other sections.\n\nCRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES (MANDATORY):\n1. VERBATIM ONLY: Copy interests EXACTLY as written in the source\n   - DO NOT translate (keep \"Football\", don't change to \"Soccer\")\n   - DO NOT simplify or generalize (keep \"Marathon running\", NOT \"Running\")\n   - DO NOT categorize or group (keep each interest separate)\n\n2. NO INFERENCE: Only extract explicitly stated interests\n   - DO NOT infer interests from other CV sections\n   - DO NOT add generic interests\n   - DO NOT deduce hobbies from skills or experiences\n\n3. COMPLETENESS: Extract ALL interests mentioned\n   - If section is absent, return empty list []\n   - Include all items even if similar (e.g., \"Chess\", \"Online Chess\" are two items)\n\n4. SECTION DETECTION:\n   - If a section title contains ANY of these keywords, treat it as the interests section:\n     \"Interest\", \"Interests\", \"Hobbies\", \"Activities\", \"Extra-curricular\"\n   - Examples of valid section headers:\n     \"Languages and Interests\"\n     \"Interests & Activities\"\n     \"Hobbies and Interests\"\n     \"Personal Interests / Languages\"\n     \"Extra-curricular Activities\"\n   - Do NOT extract from sections that only mention \"Languages\" without any interests.\n\n5. FORMAT: Return as simple string list\n   - Each interest is one string item\n   - Keep original language and terminology\n   - Preserve any descriptive terms (e.g., \"Competitive swimming\" not \"Swimming\")\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS:\n❌ Translating terms (\"Football\" → \"Soccer\")\n❌ Simplifying descriptions (\"Marathon running\" → \"Running\")\n❌ Inferring interests not explicitly stated\n❌ Grouping similar interests (\"Tennis, Badminton\" → \"Racket sports\")\n❌ Adding interests from other CV sections\n\nEXAMPLES:\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Hobbies: Chess, Marathon running, Reading science fiction\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Marathon running\", \"Reading science fiction\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (section with different name):\nSource: \"Languages and Interests: French, English, Chess, Cooking\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Cooking\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (empty):\nSource: [No interests section found]\nOutput: {\"interests\": []}\n\n❌ WRONG (translation):\nSource: \"Football, Natation\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Soccer\", \"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Football\", \"Natation\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (simplification):\nSource: \"Competitive swimming\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Competitive swimming\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (inference):\nSource: [Education section mentions \"Chess club president\"]\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": []} (not in interests section)\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"interests\": [\"verbatim interest 1\", \"verbatim interest 2\", ...]\n}\n\nIf no interests section exists, return:\n{\n  \"interests\": []\n}\n",

You must still extract interests from these sections as long as they clearly contain interests/hobbies. Do NOT extract from other sections.\n\nCRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES (MANDATORY):\n1. VERBATIM ONLY: Copy interests EXACTLY as written in the source\n   - DO NOT translate (keep \"Football\", don't change to \"Soccer\")\n   - DO NOT simplify or generalize (keep \"Marathon running\", NOT \"Running\")\n   - DO NOT categorize or group (keep each interest separate)\n\n2. NO INFERENCE: Only extract explicitly stated interests\n   - DO NOT infer interests from other CV sections\n   - DO NOT add generic interests\n   - DO NOT deduce hobbies from skills or experiences\n\n3. COMPLETENESS: Extract ALL interests mentioned\n   - If section is absent, return empty list []\n   - Include all items even if similar (e.g., \"Chess\", \"Online Chess\" are two items)\n\n4. SECTION DETECTION:\n   - If a section title contains ANY of these keywords, treat it as the interests section:\n     \"Interest\", \"Interests\", \"Hobbies\", \"Activities\", \"Extra-curricular\"\n   - Examples of valid section headers:\n     \"Languages and Interests\"\n     \"Interests & Activities\"\n     \"Hobbies and Interests\"\n     \"Personal Interests / Languages\"\n     \"Extra-curricular Activities\"\n   - Do NOT extract from sections that only mention \"Languages\" without any interests.\n\n5. FORMAT: Return as simple string list\n   - Each interest is one string item\n   - Keep original language and terminology\n   - Preserve any descriptive terms (e.g., \"Competitive swimming\" not \"Swimming\")\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS:\n❌ Translating terms (\"Football\" → \"Soccer\")\n❌ Simplifying descriptions (\"Marathon running\" → \"Running\")\n❌ Inferring interests not explicitly stated\n❌ Grouping similar interests (\"Tennis, Badminton\" → \"Racket sports\")\n❌ Adding interests from other CV sections\n\nEXAMPLES:\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Hobbies: Chess, Marathon running, Reading science fiction\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Marathon running\", \"Reading science fiction\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (section with different name):\nSource: \"Languages and Interests: French, English, Chess, Cooking\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Cooking\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (empty):\nSource: [No interests section found]\nOutput: {\"interests\": []}\n\n❌ WRONG (translation):\nSource: \"Football, Natation\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Soccer\", \"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Football\", \"Natation\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (simplification):\nSource: \"Competitive swimming\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Competitive swimming\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (inference):\nSource: [Education section mentions \"Chess club president\"]\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": []} (not in interests section)\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"interests\": [\"verbatim interest 1\", \"verbatim interest 2\", ...]\n}\n\nIf no interests section exists, return:\n{\n  \"interests\": []\n}\n",

You must still extract interests from these sections as long as they clearly contain interests/hobbies. Do NOT extract from other sections.\n\nCRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES (MANDATORY):\n1. VERBATIM ONLY: Copy interests EXACTLY as written in the source\n   - DO NOT translate (keep \"Football\", don't change to \"Soccer\")\n   - DO NOT simplify or generalize (keep \"Marathon running\", NOT \"Running\")\n   - DO NOT categorize or group (keep each interest separate)\n\n2. NO INFERENCE: Only extract explicitly stated interests\n   - DO NOT infer interests from other CV sections\n   - DO NOT add generic interests\n   - DO NOT deduce hobbies from skills or experiences\n\n3. COMPLETENESS: Extract ALL interests mentioned\n   - If section is absent, return empty list []\n   - Include all items even if similar (e.g., \"Chess\", \"Online Chess\" are two items)\n\n4. SECTION DETECTION:\n   - If a section title contains ANY of these keywords, treat it as the interests section:\n     \"Interest\", \"Interests\", \"Hobbies\", \"Activities\", \"Extra-curricular\"\n   - Examples of valid section headers:\n     \"Languages and Interests\"\n     \"Interests & Activities\"\n     \"Hobbies and Interests\"\n     \"Personal Interests / Languages\"\n     \"Extra-curricular Activities\"\n   - Do NOT extract from sections that only mention \"Languages\" without any interests.\n\n5. FORMAT: Return as simple string list\n   - Each interest is one string item\n   - Keep original language and terminology\n   - Preserve any descriptive terms (e.g., \"Competitive swimming\" not \"Swimming\")\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS:\n❌ Translating terms (\"Football\" → \"Soccer\")\n❌ Simplifying descriptions (\"Marathon running\" → \"Running\")\n❌ Inferring interests not explicitly stated\n❌ Grouping similar interests (\"Tennis, Badminton\" → \"Racket sports\")\n❌ Adding interests from other CV sections\n\nEXAMPLES:\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Hobbies: Chess, Marathon running, Reading science fiction\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Marathon running\", \"Reading science fiction\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (section with different name):\nSource: \"Languages and Interests: French, English, Chess, Cooking\"\nOutput: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\", \"Cooking\"]}\n\n✅ CORRECT (empty):\nSource: [No interests section found]\nOutput: {\"interests\": []}\n\n❌ WRONG (translation):\nSource: \"Football, Natation\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Soccer\", \"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Football\", \"Natation\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (simplification):\nSource: \"Competitive swimming\"\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Swimming\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": [\"Competitive swimming\"]}\n\n❌ WRONG (inference):\nSource: [Education section mentions \"Chess club president\"]\nWrong Output: {\"interests\": [\"Chess\"]}\nCorrect: {\"interests\": []} (not in interests section)\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"interests\": [\"verbatim interest 1\", \"verbatim interest 2\", ...]\n}\n\nIf no interests section exists, return:\n{\n  \"interests\": []\n}\n",
