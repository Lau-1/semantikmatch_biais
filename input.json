NO INFERENCE: If information is not explicitly written, use \"not found\"\n   - DO NOT guess program types (e.g., don't infer \"Summer Program\" or \"Summer School\")\n   - DO NOT infer field of study from institution name\n   - DO NOT deduce level from context clues\n\n3. FIELD SEPARATION: NEVER mix information between fields\n   - \"field\" contains ONLY domain/specialization (e.g., \"Computer Science\", \"Gestion\")\n   - \"level_of_degree\" contains ONLY academic level (e.g., \"Bachelor of Commerce\", \"Master\", \"Licence\")\n   - If unsure which field, use \"not found\" for both rather than mixing\n\n4. ABSENT vs IMPLICIT: Only extract what is EXPLICITLY stated\n   - Text says \"Bachelor of Commerce\" → Extract \"Bachelor of Commerce\" (NOT \"Bachelor\")\n   - Text says \"Summer course in Marketing\" → level: \"not found\", field: \"Marketing\"\n   - Text says \"Engineering School\" → institution: \"Engineering School\", field: \"not found\"\n\n5. QUALITY VALIDATION:\n   - After extraction, verify each field contains only ONE type of information\n   - If a field seems to contain multiple types, split correctly or use \"not found\"\n   - If in doubt, be conservative and use \"not found\"\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS (Will cause extraction to fail):\n❌ Simplifying degree names (e.g., \"Bachelor of Commerce\" → \"Bachelor\")\n❌ Adding program types not in source (e.g., \"\" → \"Summer School\")\n❌ Mixing field and level (e.g., putting \"BTS Gestion\" in level when \"Gestion\" is the field)\n❌ Translating terminology (e.g., \"Licence\" → \"Bachelor\" without explicit equivalence)\n❌ Inferring missing information from context\n\nFIELD DEFINITIONS:\n- \"university\": Educational establishment name ONLY (verbatim from source)\n- \"level_of_degree\": Academic level as EXACTLY stated (complete term, no simplification)\n- \"field\": Domain/specialization as EXACTLY stated (no inference from institution name)\n- \"country or city\": Geographic location (verbatim)\n- \"dates\": Temporal range (verbatim format)\n\nEXAMPLES:\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Bachelor of Commerce in Accounting, McGill University, 2015-2019\"\nOutput: {\n  \"university\": \"McGill University\",\n  \"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor of Commerce\",\n  \"field\": \"Accounting\",\n  \"country or city\": \"not found\",\n  \"dates\": \"2015-2019\"\n}\n\n✅ CORRECT (ambiguous case):\nSource: \"Summer 2020 - Digital Marketing course at HEC Paris\"\nOutput: {\n  \"university\": \"HEC Paris\",\n  \"level_of_degree\": \"not found\",\n  \"field\": \"Digital Marketing\",\n  \"country or city\": \"not found\",\n  \"dates\": \"Summer 2020\"\n}\n\n❌ WRONG (simplification):\nSource: \"Bachelor of Commerce, 2018\"\nWrong Output: {\"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor\"}\nCorrect: {\"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor of Commerce\"}\n\n❌ WRONG (inference):\nSource: \"HEC Paris, 2020\"\nWrong Output: {\"level_of_degree\": \"Summer Program\"}\nCorrect: {\"level_of_degree\": \"not found\"}\n\n❌ WRONG (field mixing):\nSource: \"BTS in Business Management\"\nWrong Output: {\"level_of_degree\": \"BTS Business Management\", \"field\": \"not found\"}\nCorrect: {\"level_of_degree\": \"BTS\", \"field\": \"Business Management\"}\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"studies\": [\n    {\n      \"university\": \"verbatim text or 'not found'\",\n      \"level_of_degree\": \"verbatim complete degree name or 'not found'\",\n      \"field\": \"verbatim specialization or 'not found'\",\n      \"country or city\": \"verbatim location or 'not found'\",\n      \"dates\": \"verbatim dates or 'not found'\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

ABSENT vs IMPLICIT: Only extract what is EXPLICITLY stated\n   - Text says \"Bachelor of Commerce\" → Extract \"Bachelor of Commerce\" (NOT \"Bachelor\")\n   - Text says \"Summer course in Marketing\" → level: \"not found\", field: \"Marketing\"\n   - Text says \"Engineering School\" → institution: \"Engineering School\", field: \"not found\"\n\n5. QUALITY VALIDATION:\n   - After extraction, verify each field contains only ONE type of information\n   - If a field seems to contain multiple types, split correctly or use \"not found\"\n   - If in doubt, be conservative and use \"not found\"\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS (Will cause extraction to fail):\n❌ Simplifying degree names (e.g., \"Bachelor of Commerce\" → \"Bachelor\")\n❌ Adding program types not in source (e.g., \"\" → \"Summer School\")\n❌ Mixing field and level (e.g., putting \"BTS Gestion\" in level when \"Gestion\" is the field)\n❌ Translating terminology (e.g., \"Licence\" → \"Bachelor\" without explicit equivalence)\n❌ Inferring missing information from context\n\nFIELD DEFINITIONS:\n- \"university\": Educational establishment name ONLY (verbatim from source)\n- \"level_of_degree\": Academic level as EXACTLY stated (complete term, no simplification)\n- \"field\": Domain/specialization as EXACTLY stated (no inference from institution name)\n- \"country or city\": Geographic location (verbatim)\n- \"dates\": Temporal range (verbatim format)\n\nEXAMPLES:\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Bachelor of Commerce in Accounting, McGill University, 2015-2019\"\nOutput: {\n  \"university\": \"McGill University\",\n  \"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor of Commerce\",\n  \"field\": \"Accounting\",\n  \"country or city\": \"not found\",\n  \"dates\": \"2015-2019\"\n}\n\n✅ CORRECT (ambiguous case):\nSource: \"Summer 2020 - Digital Marketing course at HEC Paris\"\nOutput: {\n  \"university\": \"HEC Paris\",\n  \"level_of_degree\": \"not found\",\n  \"field\": \"Digital Marketing\",\n  \"country or city\": \"not found\",\n  \"dates\": \"Summer 2020\"\n}\n\n❌ WRONG (simplification):\nSource: \"Bachelor of Commerce, 2018\"\nWrong Output: {\"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor\"}\nCorrect: {\"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor of Commerce\"}\n\n❌ WRONG (inference):\nSource: \"HEC Paris, 2020\"\nWrong Output: {\"level_of_degree\": \"Summer Program\"}\nCorrect: {\"level_of_degree\": \"not found\"}\n\n❌ WRONG (field mixing):\nSource: \"BTS in Business Management\"\nWrong Output: {\"level_of_degree\": \"BTS Business Management\", \"field\": \"not found\"}\nCorrect: {\"level_of_degree\": \"BTS\", \"field\": \"Business Management\"}\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"studies\": [\n    {\n      \"university\": \"verbatim text or 'not found'\",\n      \"level_of_degree\": \"verbatim complete degree name or 'not found'\",\n      \"field\": \"verbatim specialization or 'not found'\",\n      \"country or city\": \"verbatim location or 'not found'\",\n      \"dates\": \"verbatim dates or 'not found'\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

ABSENT vs IMPLICIT: Only extract what is EXPLICITLY stated\n   - Text says \"Bachelor of Commerce\" → Extract \"Bachelor of Commerce\" (NOT \"Bachelor\")\n   - Text says \"Summer course in Marketing\" → level: \"not found\", field: \"Marketing\"\n   - Text says \"Engineering School\" → institution: \"Engineering School\", field: \"not found\"\n\n5. QUALITY VALIDATION:\n   - After extraction, verify each field contains only ONE type of information\n   - If a field seems to contain multiple types, split correctly or use \"not found\"\n   - If in doubt, be conservative and use \"not found\"\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS (Will cause extraction to fail):\n❌ Simplifying degree names (e.g., \"Bachelor of Commerce\" → \"Bachelor\")\n❌ Adding program types not in source (e.g., \"\" → \"Summer School\")\n❌ Mixing field and level (e.g., putting \"BTS Gestion\" in level when \"Gestion\" is the field)\n❌ Translating terminology (e.g., \"Licence\" → \"Bachelor\" without explicit equivalence)\n❌ Inferring missing information from context\n\nFIELD DEFINITIONS:\n- \"university\": Educational establishment name ONLY (verbatim from source)\n- \"level_of_degree\": Academic level as EXACTLY stated (complete term, no simplification)\n- \"field\": Domain/specialization as EXACTLY stated (no inference from institution name)\n- \"country or city\": Geographic location (verbatim)\n- \"dates\": Temporal range (verbatim format)\n\nEXAMPLES:\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Bachelor of Commerce in Accounting, McGill University, 2015-2019\"\nOutput: {\n  \"university\": \"McGill University\",\n  \"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor of Commerce\",\n  \"field\": \"Accounting\",\n  \"country or city\": \"not found\",\n  \"dates\": \"2015-2019\"\n}\n\n✅ CORRECT (ambiguous case):\nSource: \"Summer 2020 - Digital Marketing course at HEC Paris\"\nOutput: {\n  \"university\": \"HEC Paris\",\n  \"level_of_degree\": \"not found\",\n  \"field\": \"Digital Marketing\",\n  \"country or city\": \"not found\",\n  \"dates\": \"Summer 2020\"\n}\n\n❌ WRONG (simplification):\nSource: \"Bachelor of Commerce, 2018\"\nWrong Output: {\"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor\"}\nCorrect: {\"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor of Commerce\"}\n\n❌ WRONG (inference):\nSource: \"HEC Paris, 2020\"\nWrong Output: {\"level_of_degree\": \"Summer Program\"}\nCorrect: {\"level_of_degree\": \"not found\"}\n\n❌ WRONG (field mixing):\nSource: \"BTS in Business Management\"\nWrong Output: {\"level_of_degree\": \"BTS Business Management\", \"field\": \"not found\"}\nCorrect: {\"level_of_degree\": \"BTS\", \"field\": \"Business Management\"}\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"studies\": [\n    {\n      \"university\": \"verbatim text or 'not found'\",\n      \"level_of_degree\": \"verbatim complete degree name or 'not found'\",\n      \"field\": \"verbatim specialization or 'not found'\",\n      \"country or city\": \"verbatim location or 'not found'\",\n      \"dates\": \"verbatim dates or 'not found'\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

VERBATIM ONLY: Copy text EXACTLY character-by-character from the source\n   - DO NOT simplify, abbreviate, or shorten ANY term\n   - DO NOT translate between languages (keep \"Licence\", don't change to \"Bachelor\")\n   - DO NOT merge compound terms (keep \"Bachelor of Commerce\", NOT \"Bachelor\")\n\n2. NO INFERENCE: If information is not explicitly written, use \"not found\"\n   - DO NOT guess program types (e.g., don't infer \"Summer Program\" or \"Summer School\")\n   - DO NOT infer field of study from institution name\n   - DO NOT deduce level from context clues\n\n3. FIELD SEPARATION: NEVER mix information between fields\n   - \"field\" contains ONLY domain/specialization (e.g., \"Computer Science\", \"Gestion\")\n   - \"level_of_degree\" contains ONLY academic level (e.g., \"Bachelor of Commerce\", \"Master\", \"Licence\")\n   - If unsure which field, use \"not found\" for both rather than mixing\n\n4. ABSENT vs IMPLICIT: Only extract what is EXPLICITLY stated\n   - Text says \"Bachelor of Commerce\" → Extract \"Bachelor of Commerce\" (NOT \"Bachelor\")\n   - Text says \"Summer course in Marketing\" → level: \"not found\", field: \"Marketing\"\n   - Text says \"Engineering School\" → institution: \"Engineering School\", field: \"not found\"\n\n5. QUALITY VALIDATION:\n   - After extraction, verify each field contains only ONE type of information\n   - If a field seems to contain multiple types, split correctly or use \"not found\"\n   - If in doubt, be conservative and use \"not found\"\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS (Will cause extraction to fail):\n❌ Simplifying degree names (e.g., \"Bachelor of Commerce\" → \"Bachelor\")\n❌ Adding program types not in source (e.g., \"\" → \"Summer School\")\n❌ Mixing field and level (e.g., putting \"BTS Gestion\" in level when \"Gestion\" is the field)\n❌ Translating terminology (e.g., \"Licence\" → \"Bachelor\" without explicit equivalence)\n❌ Inferring missing information from context\n\nFIELD DEFINITIONS:\n- \"university\": Educational establishment name ONLY (verbatim from source)\n- \"level_of_degree\": Academic level as EXACTLY stated (complete term, no simplification)\n- \"field\": Domain/specialization as EXACTLY stated (no inference from institution name)\n- \"country or city\": Geographic location (verbatim)\n- \"dates\": Temporal range (verbatim format)\n\nEXAMPLES:\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Bachelor of Commerce in Accounting, McGill University, 2015-2019\"\nOutput: {\n  \"university\": \"McGill University\",\n  \"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor of Commerce\",\n  \"field\": \"Accounting\",\n  \"country or city\": \"not found\",\n  \"dates\": \"2015-2019\"\n}\n\n✅ CORRECT (ambiguous case):\nSource: \"Summer 2020 - Digital Marketing course at HEC Paris\"\nOutput: {\n  \"university\": \"HEC Paris\",\n  \"level_of_degree\": \"not found\",\n  \"field\": \"Digital Marketing\",\n  \"country or city\": \"not found\",\n  \"dates\": \"Summer 2020\"\n}\n\n❌ WRONG (simplification):\nSource: \"Bachelor of Commerce, 2018\"\nWrong Output: {\"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor\"}\nCorrect: {\"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor of Commerce\"}\n\n❌ WRONG (inference):\nSource: \"HEC Paris, 2020\"\nWrong Output: {\"level_of_degree\": \"Summer Program\"}\nCorrect: {\"level_of_degree\": \"not found\"}\n\n❌ WRONG (field mixing):\nSource: \"BTS in Business Management\"\nWrong Output: {\"level_of_degree\": \"BTS Business Management\", \"field\": \"not found\"}\nCorrect: {\"level_of_degree\": \"BTS\", \"field\": \"Business Management\"}\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"studies\": [\n    {\n      \"university\": \"verbatim text or 'not found'\",\n      \"level_of_degree\": \"verbatim complete degree name or 'not found'\",\n      \"field\": \"verbatim specialization or 'not found'\",\n      \"country or city\": \"verbatim location or 'not found'\",\n      \"dates\": \"verbatim dates or 'not found'\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

VERBATIM ONLY: Copy text EXACTLY character-by-character from the source\n   - DO NOT simplify, abbreviate, or shorten ANY term\n   - DO NOT translate between languages (keep \"Licence\", don't change to \"Bachelor\")\n   - DO NOT merge compound terms (keep \"Bachelor of Commerce\", NOT \"Bachelor\")\n\n2. NO INFERENCE: If information is not explicitly written, use \"not found\"\n   - DO NOT guess program types (e.g., don't infer \"Summer Program\" or \"Summer School\")\n   - DO NOT infer field of study from institution name\n   - DO NOT deduce level from context clues\n\n3. FIELD SEPARATION: NEVER mix information between fields\n   - \"field\" contains ONLY domain/specialization (e.g., \"Computer Science\", \"Gestion\")\n   - \"level_of_degree\" contains ONLY academic level (e.g., \"Bachelor of Commerce\", \"Master\", \"Licence\")\n   - If unsure which field, use \"not found\" for both rather than mixing\n\n4. ABSENT vs IMPLICIT: Only extract what is EXPLICITLY stated\n   - Text says \"Bachelor of Commerce\" → Extract \"Bachelor of Commerce\" (NOT \"Bachelor\")\n   - Text says \"Summer course in Marketing\" → level: \"not found\", field: \"Marketing\"\n   - Text says \"Engineering School\" → institution: \"Engineering School\", field: \"not found\"\n\n5. QUALITY VALIDATION:\n   - After extraction, verify each field contains only ONE type of information\n   - If a field seems to contain multiple types, split correctly or use \"not found\"\n   - If in doubt, be conservative and use \"not found\"\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS (Will cause extraction to fail):\n❌ Simplifying degree names (e.g., \"Bachelor of Commerce\" → \"Bachelor\")\n❌ Adding program types not in source (e.g., \"\" → \"Summer School\")\n❌ Mixing field and level (e.g., putting \"BTS Gestion\" in level when \"Gestion\" is the field)\n❌ Translating terminology (e.g., \"Licence\" → \"Bachelor\" without explicit equivalence)\n❌ Inferring missing information from context\n\nFIELD DEFINITIONS:\n- \"university\": Educational establishment name ONLY (verbatim from source)\n- \"level_of_degree\": Academic level as EXACTLY stated (complete term, no simplification)\n- \"field\": Domain/specialization as EXACTLY stated (no inference from institution name)\n- \"country or city\": Geographic location (verbatim)\n- \"dates\": Temporal range (verbatim format)\n\nEXAMPLES:\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Bachelor of Commerce in Accounting, McGill University, 2015-2019\"\nOutput: {\n  \"university\": \"McGill University\",\n  \"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor of Commerce\",\n  \"field\": \"Accounting\",\n  \"country or city\": \"not found\",\n  \"dates\": \"2015-2019\"\n}\n\n✅ CORRECT (ambiguous case):\nSource: \"Summer 2020 - Digital Marketing course at HEC Paris\"\nOutput: {\n  \"university\": \"HEC Paris\",\n  \"level_of_degree\": \"not found\",\n  \"field\": \"Digital Marketing\",\n  \"country or city\": \"not found\",\n  \"dates\": \"Summer 2020\"\n}\n\n❌ WRONG (simplification):\nSource: \"Bachelor of Commerce, 2018\"\nWrong Output: {\"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor\"}\nCorrect: {\"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor of Commerce\"}\n\n❌ WRONG (inference):\nSource: \"HEC Paris, 2020\"\nWrong Output: {\"level_of_degree\": \"Summer Program\"}\nCorrect: {\"level_of_degree\": \"not found\"}\n\n❌ WRONG (field mixing):\nSource: \"BTS in Business Management\"\nWrong Output: {\"level_of_degree\": \"BTS Business Management\", \"field\": \"not found\"}\nCorrect: {\"level_of_degree\": \"BTS\", \"field\": \"Business Management\"}\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"studies\": [\n    {\n      \"university\": \"verbatim text or 'not found'\",\n      \"level_of_degree\": \"verbatim complete degree name or 'not found'\",\n      \"field\": \"verbatim specialization or 'not found'\",\n      \"country or city\": \"verbatim location or 'not found'\",\n      \"dates\": \"verbatim dates or 'not found'\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

NO INFERENCE: If information is not explicitly written, use \"not found\"\n   - DO NOT guess program types (e.g., don't infer \"Summer Program\" or \"Summer School\")\n   - DO NOT infer field of study from institution name\n   - DO NOT deduce level from context clues\n\n3. FIELD SEPARATION: NEVER mix information between fields\n   - \"field\" contains ONLY domain/specialization (e.g., \"Computer Science\", \"Gestion\")\n   - \"level_of_degree\" contains ONLY academic level (e.g., \"Bachelor of Commerce\", \"Master\", \"Licence\")\n   - If unsure which field, use \"not found\" for both rather than mixing\n\n4. ABSENT vs IMPLICIT: Only extract what is EXPLICITLY stated\n   - Text says \"Bachelor of Commerce\" → Extract \"Bachelor of Commerce\" (NOT \"Bachelor\")\n   - Text says \"Summer course in Marketing\" → level: \"not found\", field: \"Marketing\"\n   - Text says \"Engineering School\" → institution: \"Engineering School\", field: \"not found\"\n\n5. QUALITY VALIDATION:\n   - After extraction, verify each field contains only ONE type of information\n   - If a field seems to contain multiple types, split correctly or use \"not found\"\n   - If in doubt, be conservative and use \"not found\"\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS (Will cause extraction to fail):\n❌ Simplifying degree names (e.g., \"Bachelor of Commerce\" → \"Bachelor\")\n❌ Adding program types not in source (e.g., \"\" → \"Summer School\")\n❌ Mixing field and level (e.g., putting \"BTS Gestion\" in level when \"Gestion\" is the field)\n❌ Translating terminology (e.g., \"Licence\" → \"Bachelor\" without explicit equivalence)\n❌ Inferring missing information from context\n\nFIELD DEFINITIONS:\n- \"university\": Educational establishment name ONLY (verbatim from source)\n- \"level_of_degree\": Academic level as EXACTLY stated (complete term, no simplification)\n- \"field\": Domain/specialization as EXACTLY stated (no inference from institution name)\n- \"country or city\": Geographic location (verbatim)\n- \"dates\": Temporal range (verbatim format)\n\nEXAMPLES:\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Bachelor of Commerce in Accounting, McGill University, 2015-2019\"\nOutput: {\n  \"university\": \"McGill University\",\n  \"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor of Commerce\",\n  \"field\": \"Accounting\",\n  \"country or city\": \"not found\",\n  \"dates\": \"2015-2019\"\n}\n\n✅ CORRECT (ambiguous case):\nSource: \"Summer 2020 - Digital Marketing course at HEC Paris\"\nOutput: {\n  \"university\": \"HEC Paris\",\n  \"level_of_degree\": \"not found\",\n  \"field\": \"Digital Marketing\",\n  \"country or city\": \"not found\",\n  \"dates\": \"Summer 2020\"\n}\n\n❌ WRONG (simplification):\nSource: \"Bachelor of Commerce, 2018\"\nWrong Output: {\"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor\"}\nCorrect: {\"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor of Commerce\"}\n\n❌ WRONG (inference):\nSource: \"HEC Paris, 2020\"\nWrong Output: {\"level_of_degree\": \"Summer Program\"}\nCorrect: {\"level_of_degree\": \"not found\"}\n\n❌ WRONG (field mixing):\nSource: \"BTS in Business Management\"\nWrong Output: {\"level_of_degree\": \"BTS Business Management\", \"field\": \"not found\"}\nCorrect: {\"level_of_degree\": \"BTS\", \"field\": \"Business Management\"}\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"studies\": [\n    {\n      \"university\": \"verbatim text or 'not found'\",\n      \"level_of_degree\": \"verbatim complete degree name or 'not found'\",\n      \"field\": \"verbatim specialization or 'not found'\",\n      \"country or city\": \"verbatim location or 'not found'\",\n      \"dates\": \"verbatim dates or 'not found'\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

VERBATIM ONLY: Copy text EXACTLY character-by-character from the source\n   - DO NOT simplify, abbreviate, or shorten ANY term\n   - DO NOT translate between languages (keep \"Licence\", don't change to \"Bachelor\")\n   - DO NOT merge compound terms (keep \"Bachelor of Commerce\", NOT \"Bachelor\")\n\n2. NO INFERENCE: If information is not explicitly written, use \"not found\"\n   - DO NOT guess program types (e.g., don't infer \"Summer Program\" or \"Summer School\")\n   - DO NOT infer field of study from institution name\n   - DO NOT deduce level from context clues\n\n3. FIELD SEPARATION: NEVER mix information between fields\n   - \"field\" contains ONLY domain/specialization (e.g., \"Computer Science\", \"Gestion\")\n   - \"level_of_degree\" contains ONLY academic level (e.g., \"Bachelor of Commerce\", \"Master\", \"Licence\")\n   - If unsure which field, use \"not found\" for both rather than mixing\n\n4. ABSENT vs IMPLICIT: Only extract what is EXPLICITLY stated\n   - Text says \"Bachelor of Commerce\" → Extract \"Bachelor of Commerce\" (NOT \"Bachelor\")\n   - Text says \"Summer course in Marketing\" → level: \"not found\", field: \"Marketing\"\n   - Text says \"Engineering School\" → institution: \"Engineering School\", field: \"not found\"\n\n5. QUALITY VALIDATION:\n   - After extraction, verify each field contains only ONE type of information\n   - If a field seems to contain multiple types, split correctly or use \"not found\"\n   - If in doubt, be conservative and use \"not found\"\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS (Will cause extraction to fail):\n❌ Simplifying degree names (e.g., \"Bachelor of Commerce\" → \"Bachelor\")\n❌ Adding program types not in source (e.g., \"\" → \"Summer School\")\n❌ Mixing field and level (e.g., putting \"BTS Gestion\" in level when \"Gestion\" is the field)\n❌ Translating terminology (e.g., \"Licence\" → \"Bachelor\" without explicit equivalence)\n❌ Inferring missing information from context\n\nFIELD DEFINITIONS:\n- \"university\": Educational establishment name ONLY (verbatim from source)\n- \"level_of_degree\": Academic level as EXACTLY stated (complete term, no simplification)\n- \"field\": Domain/specialization as EXACTLY stated (no inference from institution name)\n- \"country or city\": Geographic location (verbatim)\n- \"dates\": Temporal range (verbatim format)\n\nEXAMPLES:\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Bachelor of Commerce in Accounting, McGill University, 2015-2019\"\nOutput: {\n  \"university\": \"McGill University\",\n  \"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor of Commerce\",\n  \"field\": \"Accounting\",\n  \"country or city\": \"not found\",\n  \"dates\": \"2015-2019\"\n}\n\n✅ CORRECT (ambiguous case):\nSource: \"Summer 2020 - Digital Marketing course at HEC Paris\"\nOutput: {\n  \"university\": \"HEC Paris\",\n  \"level_of_degree\": \"not found\",\n  \"field\": \"Digital Marketing\",\n  \"country or city\": \"not found\",\n  \"dates\": \"Summer 2020\"\n}\n\n❌ WRONG (simplification):\nSource: \"Bachelor of Commerce, 2018\"\nWrong Output: {\"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor\"}\nCorrect: {\"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor of Commerce\"}\n\n❌ WRONG (inference):\nSource: \"HEC Paris, 2020\"\nWrong Output: {\"level_of_degree\": \"Summer Program\"}\nCorrect: {\"level_of_degree\": \"not found\"}\n\n❌ WRONG (field mixing):\nSource: \"BTS in Business Management\"\nWrong Output: {\"level_of_degree\": \"BTS Business Management\", \"field\": \"not found\"}\nCorrect: {\"level_of_degree\": \"BTS\", \"field\": \"Business Management\"}\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"studies\": [\n    {\n      \"university\": \"verbatim text or 'not found'\",\n      \"level_of_degree\": \"verbatim complete degree name or 'not found'\",\n      \"field\": \"verbatim specialization or 'not found'\",\n      \"country or city\": \"verbatim location or 'not found'\",\n      \"dates\": \"verbatim dates or 'not found'\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

VERBATIM ONLY: Copy text EXACTLY character-by-character from the source\n   - DO NOT simplify, abbreviate, or shorten ANY term\n   - DO NOT translate between languages (keep \"Licence\", don't change to \"Bachelor\")\n   - DO NOT merge compound terms (keep \"Bachelor of Commerce\", NOT \"Bachelor\")\n\n2. NO INFERENCE: If information is not explicitly written, use \"not found\"\n   - DO NOT guess program types (e.g., don't infer \"Summer Program\" or \"Summer School\")\n   - DO NOT infer field of study from institution name\n   - DO NOT deduce level from context clues\n\n3. FIELD SEPARATION: NEVER mix information between fields\n   - \"field\" contains ONLY domain/specialization (e.g., \"Computer Science\", \"Gestion\")\n   - \"level_of_degree\" contains ONLY academic level (e.g., \"Bachelor of Commerce\", \"Master\", \"Licence\")\n   - If unsure which field, use \"not found\" for both rather than mixing\n\n4. ABSENT vs IMPLICIT: Only extract what is EXPLICITLY stated\n   - Text says \"Bachelor of Commerce\" → Extract \"Bachelor of Commerce\" (NOT \"Bachelor\")\n   - Text says \"Summer course in Marketing\" → level: \"not found\", field: \"Marketing\"\n   - Text says \"Engineering School\" → institution: \"Engineering School\", field: \"not found\"\n\n5. QUALITY VALIDATION:\n   - After extraction, verify each field contains only ONE type of information\n   - If a field seems to contain multiple types, split correctly or use \"not found\"\n   - If in doubt, be conservative and use \"not found\"\n\nFORBIDDEN ACTIONS (Will cause extraction to fail):\n❌ Simplifying degree names (e.g., \"Bachelor of Commerce\" → \"Bachelor\")\n❌ Adding program types not in source (e.g., \"\" → \"Summer School\")\n❌ Mixing field and level (e.g., putting \"BTS Gestion\" in level when \"Gestion\" is the field)\n❌ Translating terminology (e.g., \"Licence\" → \"Bachelor\" without explicit equivalence)\n❌ Inferring missing information from context\n\nFIELD DEFINITIONS:\n- \"university\": Educational establishment name ONLY (verbatim from source)\n- \"level_of_degree\": Academic level as EXACTLY stated (complete term, no simplification)\n- \"field\": Domain/specialization as EXACTLY stated (no inference from institution name)\n- \"country or city\": Geographic location (verbatim)\n- \"dates\": Temporal range (verbatim format)\n\nEXAMPLES:\n✅ CORRECT:\nSource: \"Bachelor of Commerce in Accounting, McGill University, 2015-2019\"\nOutput: {\n  \"university\": \"McGill University\",\n  \"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor of Commerce\",\n  \"field\": \"Accounting\",\n  \"country or city\": \"not found\",\n  \"dates\": \"2015-2019\"\n}\n\n✅ CORRECT (ambiguous case):\nSource: \"Summer 2020 - Digital Marketing course at HEC Paris\"\nOutput: {\n  \"university\": \"HEC Paris\",\n  \"level_of_degree\": \"not found\",\n  \"field\": \"Digital Marketing\",\n  \"country or city\": \"not found\",\n  \"dates\": \"Summer 2020\"\n}\n\n❌ WRONG (simplification):\nSource: \"Bachelor of Commerce, 2018\"\nWrong Output: {\"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor\"}\nCorrect: {\"level_of_degree\": \"Bachelor of Commerce\"}\n\n❌ WRONG (inference):\nSource: \"HEC Paris, 2020\"\nWrong Output: {\"level_of_degree\": \"Summer Program\"}\nCorrect: {\"level_of_degree\": \"not found\"}\n\n❌ WRONG (field mixing):\nSource: \"BTS in Business Management\"\nWrong Output: {\"level_of_degree\": \"BTS Business Management\", \"field\": \"not found\"}\nCorrect: {\"level_of_degree\": \"BTS\", \"field\": \"Business Management\"}\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with NO additional text:\n{\n  \"studies\": [\n    {\n      \"university\": \"verbatim text or 'not found'\",\n      \"level_of_degree\": \"verbatim complete degree name or 'not found'\",\n      \"field\": \"verbatim specialization or 'not found'\",\n      \"country or city\": \"verbatim location or 'not found'\",\n      \"dates\": \"verbatim dates or 'not found'\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
